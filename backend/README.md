MySeries App
============

This app will control some video players with a web/mobile interface, such as VLC and MPC-HC. Apart from
just controlling the video player, the app will save the file's state to be played later if needed. The
main point from this app is to let it run along with any torrent CSS downloader so as not to care about
if any file has been downloaded recently, as well as to let the user to start playing any video with 
just a button from the interface
